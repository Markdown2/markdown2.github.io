[Twitted bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap), ZURB Foundation are most popular frontend development CSS framework nowadays. It is absolutely useful to have support of it. It means that you can use standard bootstrap classes to format your page. And you do not need to style it. Just include `bootstrap.css`.

There is a parametr in meta section that tells interpriter to what framework to style document Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb Faundation or Materialize. Those are 3 major frameworks plan to support.

> TODO: Example of HTML generation for each framework.

On the other hand if you do not use or do not want to use bootstrap, this is still very useful and you can just ad your own CSS to format bootstrap classes that are used by Markdown 2.
