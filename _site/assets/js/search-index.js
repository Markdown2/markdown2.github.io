This is the reason it gets so popular and keep being popular for ears.But time goes and technologies changes. There was a time when HTML4 was needed and time when it was not enough. The same time came for Markdown.I do nto know how about yu, but I am not using Markdown in some of my projects just because it is very limited in terms what it can support. I canot insert Gist or Youtube video or jsbin code example.I mean I could develop my own parser and addd whatever I want to markdowns I make but I do not like this idea. I think standartisation will bring the most values to Markdown language."
