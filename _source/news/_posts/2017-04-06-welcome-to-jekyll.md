### Lets make Markdown great again!

The simple and elegant concept of Markdown language is facinating and amasing. This is the reason it gets so popular and keep being popular for ears.

But time goes and technologies changes. There was a time when HTML4 was needed and time when it was not enough. The same time came for Markdown. 

I do nto know how about yu, but I am not using Markdown in some of my projects just because it is very limited in terms what it can support. I canot insert Gist or Youtube video or jsbin code example. 

I mean I could develop my own parser and addd whatever I want to markdowns I make but I do not like this idea. I think standartisation will bring the most values to Markdown language.
